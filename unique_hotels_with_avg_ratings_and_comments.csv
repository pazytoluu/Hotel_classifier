A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Cambridge,3.574074074074074,"Breakfast was the best, and the best thing about the stay was the one and only host, great conversations at breakfast and advise on the city. Very nice neighborhood. Only reason that it did not get 5 stars is that the room has room for improvement, not any fault of the host. This is bed and breakfast, but not your honeymoon style BB, I would stay here again. Room comfort could improve with a new air conditioning unit, other then that five stars. Sharing the bathroom, never a problem, and coming in and out with you wanted never a problem. No need to rent a car, easy with public transportation."

THis BB is particularly excellent because it keeps you very close to the goings on in and around Lake Geneva, but Williams Bay is a much quieter setting and ideal for a relaxing weekend. Plenty to do if you're interested, and if not, just relax and unwind! Only potential drawback was that they let their adorable dog (Barney) on the furniture in the common areas of the house. So if you have any kind of allergies this may be a problem (wasn't for us, and he was sooo cute!) Liked Great location and the amazing breakfasts!!! (Karen's chocolate pastries were unbelievable!

Best Western Luxury Inn,Tracy,3.6666666666666665,"I stayed at the Best Western Luxury Hotel on November 4, 2010. I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances.

Camelback Resort Aquatopia Indoor Waterpark,Tannersville,2.3333333333333335,"Mediocre resort, the crowds were absurd, (the line for rentals was about 2.5 hours) and by the time we got rentals, they were out of certain sizes of skis and were making substitutions or asking people to wait fo returns. r r The trails, arguably the best part of the resort, only suit intermediate to advanced skiers. Their beginner trails are poorly marked, few and far between, and overly crowded. The advanced trails are too easy for those accustomed to skiing in Colorado. r r ...view moreService wise, the staff is a bit lazy, uninformed, and sometimes downright rude. There were multiple instances of being brushed aside when requesting help and multiple instances of staff members standing idly by while lines formed out the door. r r And suffice to say, the price that they charge is definitely not worth the experience you get. The food, which is understandably overpriced, was not fresh and caused a member of our party to get two days worth of stomach troubles from the cafeteria food. . r r In conclusion, avoid at all costs unless you really have no other choice.

I just have to remind them to refill the water cooler from time to time. But the staff is great. From time to time, when I have a bad TV, they usually fix the problem immediately, by changing the cable or the TV completely. I also love the nighttime fresh cookies at the desk especially when I get in late from work. Being close the mall is probably the best part.

Courtyard By Marriott Rockaway Mount Arlington,Mount Arlington,4.1571428571428575,"The room was generally clean nice.The problem was with the pool area the hotels eating area. Pool room was so cold that we didn't go back a 2nd time. Normally when you enter a pool area it is warm and humid, this room was absolutely freezing. I dreaded getting out of the pool and whirlpool. The whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to sit in it and have conversation because the jets were shooting water in your face. Pool area was also out of pool towels at about 7 pm. They did bring about 8 pool towels after we went to the front desk and informed them about it, but the pool room was way too cold to spend time in. They served/sold Starbucks coffee in the eating area which I thought was a plus. I went down for coffee at 8:30 am on Monday morning and the coffee was barely warm and when I got near the bottom of the cup it was filled with grounds. It tasted terrible and was not Starbucks quality for sure. I ordered a toasted bagel that must have been old. I watched her toast it for just a minute or two it was so hard that I couldn't even bite through it. I ended up throwing it out. Eating area must have some specific hours that they are open, but we did not see it posted anywhere.They didn't seem to be open at lunch time and if you were fortunate enough to find anyone in the lobby/eating area to ask, they didn't give very clear answers. I have stayed at other Marriot Courtyards and was completely satisfied, but this one was not up to par."

Kids liked the pool and there were baby ducks that came up from the river there everyday. TV's in every room so the kids didn't fight over what to watch. Master bedroom was fantastic with a jacuzzi tub. Location was convenient and Elk Springs was responsive to any needs we had. We look forward to trying one of the cabins next time as a change of pace.

What I will say is br br 1.) amazing bar / restaurant br 2.) the nicest people in the world! (I'm from Chicago, so...) br 3.) an overall cool experience. br brWe drove down the enchanted highway and stopped at each of the sculptures (I believe the first one off the expressway is in the Guinness book of world records for the largest sculpture of recycled / repurposed scrap). On day 1, we ate at the local pub (there's only 1, so you can't miss it). Once again - friendly folks, great cookin' (and cold beer!). We also toured the many historical buildings there onsite. Wonderfully warm folks - it makes me think how different the world would be if we all treated each other as nicely. So the bottom line - Regent and the Enchanted Castle get two thumbs up.

Grand Hotel Cadenabbia,Griante,3.4642857142857144,"We stayed at the Grand Hotel Cadenabbia for our second visit. We previously stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon 8 years ago. The location is perfect. Our room overlooked the Lake which was magical. The hotel is across the Lake from Bellagio which is a short boat ride away and there are restaurants and pizzerias within a short walk of the hotel in either direction. Also the hotel is directly next door to the Villa Carlotta (a stately house and botanical gardens, well worth a visit). However the Hotel decor has not changed at all since our last visit 8 years ago, and it is showing. The rooms were sparsely decorated, the shower leaked everywhere and the TV was the oldest, grainiest model I've seen in years. The breakfast restaurant commanded beautiful views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality. The bacon was greasy and the sausages looked ominous. They had prossecco available to drink though and had a wonderful tasting coffee and hot chocolate machine. The waiters were all dressed in fine uniforms that although smart looked as though they were designed in the 40's. The whole hotel needs a kick into the modern day. But all in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel to everyone we meet. If you stay here, you will have a good time on the lake, but don't expect modern luxuries."
Grandison Bed Breakfast,Oklahoma City,5.0,"Excellent BB- All areas beautifully appointed. In addition to breakfast in the dining room. (Which I would request) there is a small kitchen alcove upstairs for tea, coffee or pastries. Rooms are lovely! Luxurious bedding and pillows. Common areas very tasteful! Service is good. There are also great restaurants, such as Cattlemen's Steak, that are just a short drive away. This is a perfect location if you need to be close to certain hospitals! Children stay free but I would be cautious in this location. You may want to drive out to Guthrie for antique shopping!"

It hasn't been updated in decades, the carpet was so worn I wouldn't walk around without shoes, the bed was all springs and sunken in, and overall it was dark and dingy. The motel room door was underneath a stairwell around a corner so it did not feel safe in the dark. My sliding door was unlocked when I first checked in which did not make me feel safe. If I had planned to stay more than 2 days I would have left and gone to another hotel even though it was non-refundable."

There is a play-area were guests can explore their BDSM side, but the area has become run down and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables.

We selected this hotel because we were traveling with a group of my daughter's friends and we knew the kids would be happy to have a pool to swim in. Well, so much for that, the kids could not even swim in the big pool because it was so cold. They moved to the hot tub and after a few minutes we had a bunch of blue lipped 4 year olds. The funky,sour, old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room was enough to make me consider never using the Holiday Inn Express chain again!"

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Memphis Southwind,Memphis,3.803030303030303,"Check-in was fast and easy. There are only three floors, so it was easy to get to your room. The hotel is on an OK side of town - not the best - but worth the price. Lots of places to eat nearby and the morning continental breakfast was decent. Linens were clean room was nice and cold (Summer weather outside) and I didn't get rudely awakened by cleaning staff. My only complaint is that my room overlooked a street lamp and there were no drapes over the window sheers to block out the light at night. Not all rooms are like this of course. Overall, a great choice if you're needing to stay in the Southwind area."

How do you not have the room that someone booked over a month ago that was non refundable The carpet was wet so had to put towels down and the comment for that was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms. By the next day, we were not changing at that point. Never will stay again!!!"

Every year before this one it was no problem but this year it was the wrost! I feel like we were racially profiled. My kids where not acting bad or anything be cause I have control over them. But for some reason this women who was in the pool area with us decided she was going to tell the manager that we were all over the pool! Really! Like she had to have the whole pool to her self.

Hotel Casena Dei Colli,Palermo,3.765625,"We hugely enjoyed this holiday. We had not been to Sicily before and this was an excellent base for exploring several parts of the island - including some beautiful sites, all the more so for being decked in spring flowers. The Greek temples at Selinunte and Segesta were especially impressive as were the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, although it was almost 3 hours drive over the mountains in the centre of the island to the latter. We also very much enjoyed the food - the seafood was excellent (even if ultimately disappointing in Porticello, where much is landed from the boats). There are several good restaurants near the hotel including La Brasiera and (more expensively) La Caseta de la Nonna. In short, we can't wait to return to Sicily and visit some other areas. The hotel very much suited our needs, and as part of a package deal (with flights and hire car) was very good value. Driving around Palermo is quite challenging and we advise full insurance cover as it is rare to see a car without scratches down the side. Top tip: make sure you have a map to the hotel from the airport or a sat nav as without this (as we discovered in a torrential rain storm) it is very hard to find your way around the outskirts of Palermo with its many one-way streets. The hotel has secure parking (at an extra cost) and rooms have air conditioning or heating. Careful if you leave your windows open as there are Mosquitos (in the spring at least)."

Hotel Portaventura,Stone Creek,3.76271186440678,"Port Aventura is the perfect base for theme park fans but here's a warning - the food in the park will turn your stomach as much a ride around the loops of 'Dragon Khan'. From the relatively tranquil settings of the hotel pools you can pop through an exclusive turnstile straight into Meditterania and enjoy all the fun of what has to be the best theme park outside of Florida. The hotel is immaculately kept with the quaint look of a Mediterranean village and offers acres of outdoor space to stretch out and soak up the sun although, like most hotels it fails to provide enough shade and parasols are scarce. The rooms have recently been renovated and there's free Wi-Fi in all areas (as at July 2014). In the neighbouring theme park there's an amazing variety of rides and shows to suit everyone. The main gripe is the lack of decent food in any of the restaurants. With the exception of Rac de Mar near the entrance we experienced cold, bland and overpriced dishes at all of the restaurants in addition to poor service. At The Iron Horse Hotel and the Steak House we could not distinguish between any of the meats served. Most of it tasted like I cooked it - which isn't great! For those staying at the hotel I would suggest you take advantage of the ample breakfast and eat out at nearby Salou for half the price and twice the choice. Its just a few minutes in a taxi to the main promenade."

Located next to Dave and Busters and when it closed there was lots of yelling and reving of car engines and carrying on for atleast 30 minutes or more when we was trying to sleep. Not sure if it was an isolated happening or its every night that way. Then there was a generator that ran all night long in the next parking lot which kept us from being able to sleep well Saturday night.

The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture. We could stop anytime we wanted for a photo and we had plenty of time at sites; we just all sauntered back to the bus when we were ready. The groups size was limited to 14 so I didn't feel crowded and everywhere seemed off-season!"

They quoted us one rate and changed it when we checked out. When we talked to the management about it, he accused us of making up rates and offered us an insulting $10 off our rooms after we (bride and groom) had spent over $1400 there in two days, not counting the 10+ rooms booked for at least two nights each by friends and family.On a health and cleanliness note, we went to use the jacuzzi tub and brown, slimy stuff came out of the jets when we turned them on, a clear sign of an inproperly cleaned tub.BAD GUEST SERVICE!!!!"

Ocean Breeze Motel Apts,Fort Lauderdale,4.0,"I am the disabled victim of a drunk driver. For 5 years now, I have been on very heavy doses of narcotic pain medication, and will be for life. It is very dangerous living alone, and I won't tolerate another human living with me. So, I have a specially trained dog trained as an alert dog to watch me and make my life safe to live. Last month, we (my dog, Dana and I) went to Ft Lauderdale, and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel. We had a wonderful stay. The motel doesn't allow regular p...view moreets, which is one of the reasons we chose it. Less to possibly distract Dana. Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again.

Sam's Town Hotel & Gmblng Hall,Robinsonville,,"This mammoth entertainment complex draws more tourists than Graceland, and for good reason. The SceneBilly Bob's Steak House Saloon boasts it has the biggest Angus steaks in the Delta, but of course that's not the main draw at the entertainment complex. Sam's Town Hotel Gambling Hall has become one of the largest tourist attractions in the Memphis area (in terms of people it pulls in) due to its nationally known musical headliners, as well as its gambling action. The Old West-style casino has a million square feet that includes the 1,600-seat River Palace Arena, where acts such as Wynonna and Willie Nelson draw top ticket prices. Two sports bars with big-screen TVs also feature entertainment and sporting events. Then, of course, there's the table gaming, slots, and casino atmosphere that have made Sam's Town synonymous with good times and entertainment.Must Have DrinksGrab a beer and let it ride."

Seaside Oceanfront Inn & Restaurant,Seaside,,Unless you like hangling out in nursing homes avoid! I have never written a review on anything in my life but I have to say something so nobody else has a horrible stay at Seaside. The hotel is as tacky as it gets. Stuffed animals everywhere. The AC didn't work and we couldn't sleep! The towels in the bathroom looked like they were 10 years old! The place smelled like a nursing home. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. If we could of gotten our money back we would of changed hotels. We stayed in the Jungle room which meant they put about 50 stuffed animals over the bed and hung monkeys from the ceiling. My two year old thought is was cool but my husband and I were annoyed! I understand they were trying to go with a theme but it was very tacky! Please do yourself a huge favor and stay somewhere else! Our weekend was ruined and we felt ripped off!

To top it off the house behind us had a dog which could hear you once you walked into the bathroom (the window was open) and would bark endlessly. Way overpriced too.

Sportsmen Motel,Port Angeles,5.0,"My parents came to visit, and we headed to Olympic National Park. We called to reserve a room at the Sportsmen Motel.

I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed the night, and not only was the staff (a mother and daughter) very friendly and accommodating, giving restaurant recommendations (try Blue Flame BBQ a few bu...view moreildings away...oh.my.god.), but the room was cleaner than my house (really clean), the second bed had its own locking bedroom, and there was a full kitchen, with a big fridge, pots and pans, plates, coffee and coffee maker, etc. It was 90, including tax, and I was very impressed. This place rocks!view less"
Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,3.214193548387097,The hotel was great for the price. It was close to Universal Studios. When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book! Again though for the price of the room it was a good deal and worked for what I needed.

Sutton Bay Resort,Newman Lake,,"Great Memories, Great People! Sutton Bay is a Beautiful resort and we have found it to be extremely family friendly, clean and affordable. Management is always helpful and our experience has been that there is NO tolerance for underage drinking or out of control drinking of any kind for that matter. Managements goal is clearly to provide a fun, safe and clean atmosphere for families to spend the day, week or even summer camping, fishing, swimming or hiking. They (management) have devoted their life to this cause and this is clearly evident. We look forward to many more memories at Sutton Bay and it is our opinion that any negative postings came to be as a form of retaliation from a person or persons that either had trouble following the simple rules or were refused service for a valid reason, almost always for the protection or consideration of the other guests.

We are smokers and wanted a smoking room. They didn't have any smoking rooms left, but the owner handed us an ashtray and said...view more it's a smoking room now. I wouldn't mind smoking outside if they didn't have any smoking rooms left, but when I got to the room, I understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray. The carpet was atrocious and when I went to take a shower, the handle to turn the water on came off in my hand. The tiles were missing all over the bathroom, the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. They advertise coffee makers and alarm clocks. Not only did we not have either, there was no remote to the TV either. The smell in the room made me think they had just removed a corpse or something as equally bad.

Tulip Inn Turin West,New York,4.1875,Hotel was fine and staff were pleasant. Only confusion was breakfast charge. We were told at checkin it was included but were then charged as the receptionist made a mistake. Unfortunate as on of the group paid 9 euros for a coffee and yogurt.

Twelve Hotels & Residences,Atlanta,3.404255319148936,"Terrific, classy, and Chic Hotel Close To Everything Atlanta I have enjoyed both single rooms and suites at the hotel. Both were very nice. The hotel lobby and common areas are well designed and very welcoming spaces. Finding your way around, finding the front desk, finding the elevator are all easy and just short steps from one another. The rooms themselves all have full kitchens, granite counters and very spacious. There is a sitting area with desk and flatscreen television as well as computer. The bedrooms are separate also with flat television. The beds were well made and designed and very comfortable. Along the back wall is floor to ceiling windows and because the rooms are designed with a loft atmosphere these windows are huge, perhaps 16 feet high. I loved the design of these rooms. The furniture was well chosen and the ambience was so loft like as well as home like that I was instantly as ease. Check out the Lobby restaurant and the street scene called Atlantic Station."

Ubaa Old Crawford Inn,Des Plaines,4.0,"The Ubaa in Skokie is a great place to go either for a drink and dinner after work, or with the kids for dinner. It is divided into two separate sides one is the U shaped bar (smoking allowed) and the other is a homey restaurant in which you can not tell that someone is smoking anywhere nearby. My regular order here is a Blue Moon beer and the spicy chicken sandwich, ordered SPICY, never medium. They have friendly service, a nice atmosphere to relax, and good food. The fried mushrooms are great and come with their special sauce, and their fries are round slices off an actual potato which are crisp outside and fluffy potato goodness inside. This is a great local pub style place that has been around forever and will hopefully stay."

Villa Carlotta,Medina,4.9,Spent two nights and came away very impressed. Most fine hotels in Taormina have great sea views but Villa Carlotta ups the game by providing excellent friendly service-beginning with a warm welcome and property by managers followed by a glass of prosecco in their top floor dining room terrace along. Large and well appointed rooms and helpful staff. A stunning pool and garden area - although weather would not oblige. Would not take kids there (although there were several families on property) and caution those with mobility issues to beware as Villa Carlotta is a good walk uphill from the center of town. Bountiful breakfast on top floor terrace room. Will certainly return.

Wilshire Inn Motel,Cushing,1.0,"The staff were very rude. Didn't change blankets. Rooms were very small. The sign said free breakfast but they only offer cereal and milk and when I took my children to the office they didn't have any milk and it was when they just started to allow guests to get quotbreakfastquot and were not going to get any more. My husband wasn't able to see the place before he paid for a week stay because he was at work but it was the most unpleasant week of our stay in Oklahoma out of the two months. I suggest Drumright inn! It's like 10 minutes out of Cushing off the OK highway. We seen there lodging and it was very nice. Because we were a family of 5, they offered us to stay at one of their houses that they rent. VERY NICE and AFFORDABLE! But summary of this review is I wouldn't stay at the Wilshire Inn Motel ever again in my life unless I was so desperate and just needed a closed room and bed."
